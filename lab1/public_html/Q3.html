    <h1 style="text-align: center">Nokia N70</h1>
    <p> If the Nokia N70 phone had a twin , it has to be the <u>6680</u>.Not only do both 
        smart phones share an almost similar design,they slao offer much of the same
        specifications,from <i>3G</i> connectivity and <i>RS-MMC</i> expansion slot to the
        <b>Symbian Series 60</b> platform.Fortunately, as with any upgrade models,the
        triband N70 does come with server enhancements including a <b><u>2-megapixel</b></u>
        camera and an improvement handset design.</body><br><br>
        
        <p>One question beckons.Can the N70 emulate the success of its predecessor?</p>
