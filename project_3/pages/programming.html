            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>I started learning programming only a year ago, but I have learned a variety of languages.</p>

                    <h3>C</h3>
                    <p>I just started learning C this month. The project I recently completed was a simple multifunctional command-line interface. This interface has three features: a Hangman game, basic arithmetic calculations, and a word counter.</p>

                    <h3>C++</h3>
                    <p>I also learned C++ earlier. I did a lot of hardware coding with C++. One of the newer projects I completed is a computer memory simulator that uses Arduino to simulate the CPU.</p>

                    <h3>Assembly</h3>
                    <p>One of the hardest languages I have learned is Assembly, and I'm still getting used to writing it. Most of my projects in Assembly are simple. One project involved writing a program that counts how many numbers in an array are divisible by 2.</p>

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>I have completed many projects in Python. The coolest one so far is a navigation simulator that allows users to create any map, and it shows the shortest path to travel from one destination to another.</p>
