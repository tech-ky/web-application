        <h1>Kai Yang</h1>            
        <p>
            My name is Kai Yang. I was born in Malaysia, where I spent my early childhood with my grandparents. They played a significant role in my upbringing, providing me with love and support during those formative years. At the age of five, my family decided to move to Singapore in search of better educational opportunities. This move was crucial for my development, as it allowed me to access a higher quality of education and a more diverse learning environment.
    
            Adapting to life in Singapore was not without its challenges. Initially, I struggled with my studies, primarily because my parents are not English speakers. Their limited proficiency in English made it difficult for them to help me with my schoolwork. However, I was determined to succeed. After completing kindergarten at a neighborhood school run by the government, I enrolled in Punggol Primary School, where I began to find my footing.
    
            My hard work paid off when I took the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). I scored 196, which enabled me to enter the Normal Academic (NA) stream at ZhSS. This was a significant achievement for me, as it marked a turning point in my academic journey. I later transitioned to the Express stream in Secondary 2, which further challenged me and allowed me to push my boundaries.
    
            After completing my O-Levels, I achieved an L1R5 score of 13 raw points. This accomplishment was a testament to my perseverance and determination. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic. This field fascinates me because it combines my interests in technology and problem-solving.
    
            I created this webpage not only to share information about myself but also to practice my web development skills. Through this project, I hope to provide insight into my life and aspirations while continuing to improve my abilities in creating engaging and user-friendly webpages. I invite you to explore my journey and learn more about who I am.
