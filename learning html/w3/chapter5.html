    <h2><b>What lets us classify an animal as a bird?</b></h2>
    <p>A bird is a warm-blooded vertebrate characterized by its ability to lay eggs, a feature shared with many other animals. Birds are unique for their feathers, which provide insulation, aid in flight, and serve as a means of communication and camouflage. They possess beaks or bills, which vary in shape and size depending on their diet and feeding habits, as birds lack teeth. Most birds are capable of flight, although some species, like ostriches and penguins, have adapted to running or swimming instead. Birds have a high metabolic rate, a lightweight skeleton, and strong muscles that make them well-suited for their active lifestyles. Additionally, they are known for their keen senses, particularly their vision, which is vital for navigation, hunting, and avoiding predators.</p>

    <h2><b>What lets us classify an animal as a fish?</b></h2>
    <p>Fish are cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates that primarily live in water environments. They are characterized by their gills, which allow them to extract oxygen from water, and their scales, which provide protection and reduce friction as they swim. Most fish have streamlined bodies and fins that aid in propulsion and maneuverability in water. Fish are incredibly diverse, ranging from tiny, colorful tropical species to large predators like sharks. They reproduce in various ways, with many laying eggs, while some, like certain sharks and livebearers, give birth to live young. Fish are found in nearly every aquatic habitat on Earth, from freshwater rivers and lakes to the deepest ocean trenches.</p>

    <h2><b>What lets us classify an animal as a mammal?</b></h2>
    <p>Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates distinguished by their ability to produce milk, which they use to nurse their young. This group of animals is also characterized by the presence of hair or fur, a neocortex region in the brain, and three middle ear bones. Mammals have a wide range of adaptations that allow them to live in diverse environments, from the depths of the ocean to the highest mountains. Most mammals give birth to live young, although a few, such as the platypus and echidna, lay eggs. Mammals are highly diverse in form and function, ranging from tiny shrews to massive whales, and include humans, who are part of this animal class.</p>

    <h2><b>What lets us classify an animal as a reptile?</b></h2>
    <p>Reptiles are cold-blooded vertebrates that primarily live on land, although some species are aquatic or semi-aquatic. They are characterized by their scaly skin, which helps prevent water loss, making them well-suited for dry environments. Reptiles typically lay shelled eggs on land, but some species give birth to live young. Their metabolism is ectothermic, meaning they rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. This class of animals includes a wide range of species such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles, which have adapted to various environments across the globe, from deserts to rainforests.</p>

    <h2><b>What lets us classify an animal as a amphibians?</b></h2>
    <p>Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that have a dual life, spending part of their lives in water and part on land. They typically undergo metamorphosis from a water-dwelling larval stage, like a tadpole, to a terrestrial adult stage. Amphibians have moist, permeable skin that allows for respiration, but it also makes them vulnerable to dehydration. They usually lay eggs in water, which then hatch into larvae that eventually transform into adult forms. This group includes frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. Amphibians are often indicators of environmental health, as they are highly sensitive to changes in their surroundings due to their permeable skin and complex life cycles.</p>
