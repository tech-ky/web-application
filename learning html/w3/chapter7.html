QUESTION:
You have been given a paragraph of text. Use HTML text formatting elements to style the text as follows:

1. Make the word "important" bold.
2. Emphasize the phrase "really matters".
3. Italicize the word "unique".
4. Make the word "smaller" in smaller font size.
5. Highlight the phrase "pay attention".
6. Make the phrase "needs correction" appear as deleted.
7. Show the corrected version "corrected" as inserted text.
8. Write the chemical formula "H2O" with the correct subscript.
9. Display the mathematical expression "E=mc^2" with the correct superscript.

Here is the paragraph:

"In any kind of communication, it's important to highlight what really matters. When conveying a unique message, sometimes a smaller text size is needed. Also, make sure to pay attention to details, especially when something needs correction, such as replacing 'incorrect' with 'corrected'. Finally, scientific and mathematical expressions like H2O or E=mc^2 require proper formatting."
