<!--In HTML, the <meta> tag is used to provide metadata about the webpage.
 Metadata is information about the webpage that doesn't appear directly on
  the page but helps browsers, search engines, and other services understand
 the content and behavior of the page.

The <meta> tag is placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document.
 Some common uses of metadata include:
-->

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the webpage content">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="Your Name">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
<meta property="og:title" content="Your Webpage Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="Description for social media">
<meta property="og:image" content="image-url.jpg">
